The code for running the experiments is found in my GitHub at:
    https://github.com/kapoor1992/CS7641/tree/master/Assignment1

The data used is available in the same repository:
    https://github.com/kapoor1992/CS7641/tree/master/Assignment1/utilities/data

The requirement to run the algorithms is the Scikit-learn library for Python 3.

Once it has been installed, navigating to these files will allow for quick runs of the algorithms:

For example, to run the KNN algorithms on the datasets, please run:
    python3 knn.py
